- 👋 Hi, I’m @dr-n2keul
<br>

-- PhD in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology
  -- https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-keul-phd-- Largely a benchtop scientist by training (12+ years experience in protein structural biology). 
  -- I have a deep passion for understanding the interplay between enzyme dyanmics and protein function.
  -- Multiple peer-reviewed publications and patented scientist.

-- Love all things science (quantum world to astronomy)
-- The evolution of enzyme structure and function is intrinsically tied at the molecular level to the environment of the host and/or the final destination of a given enzyme produced by a specific organism within a population.
    -- When chance and time are the only pre-requesites for evolution at both the micro and macro level. A protein engineer has much to explore in a vast environment, where time therefore, the chief consideration as we progress to decoupling the 'wigglings and jigglings' of atoms that facilitate life (e.g., enzyme dynamics and the interplay with enzyme function)

- 👀 I’m interested in ...
  -- AI and the utility in structural biology, with a specific focus on protein dynamics as we slowly make headway on the "protein folding problem". Dynamics is the next frontier. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
  -- Always stay learning, varies by day
  -- Read a publication (peer-reviewed) a day <-- best advice I ever received
  -- "One hour of reading will save you an hour of troubleshooting" -- Someone Wise

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
  -- AI backtesting of crypto markets and identifying trends to make projections and/or alert a trader when volatility is high
  -- AI data analysis and deployment using: experimental data from in silico based predictions (relating to protein structural biology) [innovative idea with PoC's in real life, just need help computationally)
  -- Data management systems for expanding biotechnological flow-through (experiment --> analyses reduction time)
    -- With historical data for comparison (database backend)
  -- In silico prediction software for proteins in parameterized force-fields (MD) where the intracellular crowding component is also built-in prior to a given simulation (explicit or implicit macromolecular crowding basically--need help here)
  -- Anyone who can be a great mentor and anywhere I can help out

** All programs on here are open source and I just ask that if any updates are made to said programs, out of curiosity, I would love to know how the programs were expanded for other utilities**
